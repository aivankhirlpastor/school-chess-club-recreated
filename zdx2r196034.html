                    <p>
                        Chess is a 2-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 chequered board. Each player controls either the white or black pieces, and the goal is to trap the opponent's king in a position where it cannot move to safety. The chess board consists of 64 alternating colour squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.<sup><a href="https://www.chessstrategyonline.com/content/tutorials/how-to-play-chess-introduction" target="_blank" title="Introduction to Chess - Chess Strategy Online">1</a></sup> The game has a long history, originating in India around the 6th century AD and spreading to the Middle East and Europe.<sup><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess#:~:text=Chess%20first%20appeared%20in%20India%20about%20the%206th%20century%20CE%20as%20a%20game%20called%20chaturanga.%20By%20the%2010th%20century%20it%20had%20spread%20from%20Asia%20to%20the%20Middle%20East%20and%20Europe" target="_blank" title="Chess | Game, Setup, Board, & Pieces | Britannica">2</a></sup><br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>THE CHESS PIECE</h2>
                    <p>
                        One piece must be moved to a new square on each turn. The players alternately advance a piece after the person with the white pieces moves first. In chess, there are no dice; instead, each piece moves in a unique fashion, and you choose which piece to move. Plus, each piece can 'take', or capture, an opposing piece. All you have to do is move your piece or pawn onto the square that the opponent piece is on and take it off the board.<sup><a href="https://www.chessstrategyonline.com/content/tutorials/how-to-play-chess-introduction#:~:text=detail%20later%20on.-,The%20Chess%20Pieces,-Each%20player%20has" target="_blank" title="Introduction to Chess - Chess Strategy Online">3</a></sup><br><br>

                    <h2>ARRANGE THE SET</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every player must always have a light-colored square in their lower right corner of the board. Even TV shows occasionally make the error of putting the board in the incorrect orientation. You can begin adding the pieces as soon as the board is correctly oriented. On each player's side of the board, their pieces begin on the first rank (called "ranks" in chess) of horizontal rows.<sup><a href="https://www.chessstrategyonline.com/content/tutorials/how-to-play-chess-introduction#:~:text=Setting%20up%20the%20board" target="_blank" title="Introduction to Chess - Chess Strategy Online">4</a></sup><br><br>
